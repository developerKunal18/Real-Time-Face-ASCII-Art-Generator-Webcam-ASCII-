# 🎥 Real-Time ASCII Webcam Art Generator 

## 💡 Overview
The **Real-Time ASCII Webcam Generator** transforms your live webcam feed into ASCII art directly inside the terminal.  
Each frame is captured, converted to grayscale, downscaled, and mapped to ASCII characters that match pixel brightness.

This project combines **computer vision + artistic rendering + real-time processing**, creating a cool hacker-style visual effect.
